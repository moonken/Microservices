In this project, we experimented with and evaluated two existing frameworks, Axon and Eventuate, that implements data consistency for distributed transactions using Saga pattern. The two frameworks are similar in principle. Both of them implement Saga pattern and CQRS view. From a end-userâ€™s point of view, however, there are identifiable tradeoffs in choosing either of the frameworks. In short, Eventuate, being the newer design of the two, is more user-friendly and provides better decoupling of components in the system. However, comparing to Axon, it is more unstable and performs worse due to its shorter development time. Axon, on the other hand, has a less-friendly API with tighter coupling of components such as handlers for commands and events. Moreover, between the two frameworks, Axon is relatively more light-weight because it only provides a skeleton structure, whereas Eventuate provides functional implementation for most parts of the system and therefore contains more scaffolding code.
